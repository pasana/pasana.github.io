I"½<p>To train a good quality chatbot from scratch usually requires either a lot of data or a very limited context. After all, its developers are interested in the successful completion of tasks by the chatbot, but are rarely interested in a detailed description of the context, where all possible situations will be considered and provided for. It is more efficient to develop a chatbot that will slowly figure it out in the proposed context.</p>
