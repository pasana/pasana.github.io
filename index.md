## Hi,

I am PhD student at ALIAE start-up and LORIA working on Human-Machine Dialog in the Medical Domain based in Nancy, France. I've been working on the similar topic with the same team during 3rd year project and the internship of Erasmus+ exchange program in Mines Nancy supervised by Philippe Jolivet and prof. Claire Gardent.

I have received my master degree in Data Mining in Project Management from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and IASA department as well as bachelor degree in System Analysis.

During my studies I succeeded to gain industrial experience, especially in data mining, machine learning, natural language processing & understanding.
