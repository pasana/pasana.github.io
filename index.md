## Hi,

I am a research engineer at ALIAE start-up based in Nancy, France. My current focus is graph-based retrieval models and evaluation framework for the dialogue system based on the whole performance and its components.

My journey with ALIAE started during Erasmus+ exchange program in Mines Nancy with 3rd year project about semantic corpus augumentation which further developped into internship. Later, I completed PhD on Human-Machine Dialog in the Medical Domain under academic supervision of Claire Gardent at LORIA and Lorraine University and industrial supervision of Phlippe Jolivet at ALIAE.
