Hi!

I am PhD student at ALIAE start-up and LORIA working on Human-Machine Dialog in the Medical Domain based in Nancy, France. I've been working on the similar topic with the same team during the internship of Erasmus+ exchange program in Mines Nancy.

I have received my master degree in Data Mining in Project Management from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and IASA department as well as bachelor degree in System Analysis.

During my studies I succeeded to gain industrial experience, especially in data mining, machine learning, natural language processing & understanding techniques. 

More detailed information is available in my CV.

I'm highly interested in developing my skills in reinforcement learning, Markov models, applications of graph theory and applying them in healthcare, psychology, neuroscience, economics domains.

During my leisure time I enjoy travelling, reading, learning languages, going deep into different cultures and philosophy.
