Hi!

I am a research engineer at ALIAE start-up based in Nancy, France. My current focus is graph-based retrieval models and evaluation framework for the dialogue system based on the whole performance and its components.

My journey with ALIAE started during Erasmus+ exchange program in Mines Nancy with 3rd year project about semantic corpus augumentation which further developped into internship. Later, I completed PhD on Human-Machine Dialog in the Medical Domain under academic supervision of Claire Gardent at LORIA and Lorraine University and industrial supervision of Phlippe Jolivet at ALIAE.

I have received my master degree in Data Mining in Project Management from Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and IASA department as well as bachelor degree in System Analysis. During these studies I also succeeded to gain industrial experience, especially in data mining, machine learning, natural language processing & understanding. 

More detailed information is available in my CV.

I'm highly interested in developing my skills in reinforcement learning, Markov models, applications of graph theory and applying them in healthcare, psychology, neuroscience, economics domains.

During my leisure time I enjoy travelling, reading & writing, dancing latino, growing plants and going deep into different cultures and philosophy.
